dear friend ,
not know each other before now . i am mrs . juliana mbuluku makele , the
wife of late tate makele , a farmer in zimbabwe who was
murdered in the land dispute in my country . i got your contact through
before the death of my husband , he made a deposit with a security firm .
diplomatic
content is the sum of us 25 . 5 million ( twenty five million , five
hundred
thousand united states dollars only ) . this was done when he noticed
the
looming danger in zimbabwe on land policies . the security company does
not know
the actual contents of the two - box out of the ten trunk boxes /
this mount was meant for the purchase of new agricultural machineries
and
chemicals for our farms and establishment of new farms in swaziland .
this land problem came when zimbabwean president mr . robert mugabe
introduced a new land act reform that wholly affected the rich white
and mob action by zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the
society during political elections in my country . in fact a lot of
people
were killed because of this land reform act for which my husband was
one
of
the victims .
it is against this background that , all my family members fled
zimbabwe
for fear of our
lives . we are currently taking refuge in the ghana where we sort
husband ' s
money is not being used ,
lying in the security company .
i must let you know that this transaction is
reaching a workable agreement with you .
