hi paliourg ,
me and my friends , estelle , adela , and brandi
are waiting for you ; ) so
never cackle unless you lay .
the bigger they are the harder they fall . . silence is less injurious than a bad reply . . nothing is ill said if it is not ill taken . . a fool in a gown is none the wiser . .
no more ?
. better safe than sorry . . true beauty lies within . . a bad excuse is better then none . .
