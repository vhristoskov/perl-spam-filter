dear friend ,
i am mr . richard mayer , the accountant general of nedbank of south
u . s . d . 32 million .
on september 2001 , an american pilot , mr . roy kenob , an american ational
made a fixed deposit of u . s d 32 million in ned bank of south africa . on
reply . after a month , i sent a reminder and finally his employers
embassy proved fruitless .
when he was making deposition in my bank , he did not declare his next of
kin in his deposit application form , when i reminded him he said he
wished it so , in the conservative manner of our bank , i did not turn down
his request rather honor it considering his high net worth . the point is
that his employer are not aware of his deposit with us , therefore i am the
only person who know about mr . roy ' s deposit of u . s . d 32 , 000 , 000 . 00 which
mr . kenob ' s deposit is also with me .
i am looking forward for a foreigner who will stand in as the next of
of late mr . roy kenob , in support of your claim including certificate of
that .
expenses as we may incure in the course of concluding this transaction .
i am urgently waiting for your positive reply on the address below .
regards ,
mr . richard mayer
