it ' shere
it ' sjustforfun
teotihuacan
sunblind and sweating ,
we weaved down dusty lanes ,
past volcanoes spewing ashen memories
that blanketed peasant farmers
camping on the hillsides
fields woven with agave
skipped by our
rickety mexican coach
as sand danced on its windows ,
screening our world in bronze
anabella pulled her white hat over her eyes
as the sun warmed my back ;
i breathed in broken spanish
