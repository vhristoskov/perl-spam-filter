calvary greetings ! !
my name is mrs . ruth makary a 65 yrs old lady . i am a cancer patient and a
crash in december 1999 . we were married for eleven years without a child .
before his death we were devoted christians . when my late husband was alive
we protected our assets of $ usd 5 million through the purchase of a life
company . i was irrevocably designates as beneficiaries of the policy . the
unfortunately he dies .
problem . though what disturbs me most is my stroke . i developed this
sickness as a result of the sudden shock and hearth attack i had when the
1999 .
ensure that the house of god is maintained .
this money and my husbands relatives are of questionable characters and are
unbelievers and i would dislike a situation where this money will be used in
an ungodly manner . hence the reasons for taking this bold decision .
i am not afraid of death hence i know where i am going and everyone is
exodus 14 vs 14 says that the lord will fight my case and i shall hold my
with god all things are possible .
the liquidation of this asset would incur some expenses . please i urge you
reality for the doing of god own thing . god loves a cheerful giver and i
must serve him in spirit and truth . please always be prayerful all through
your life . any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for other
people for this same purpose .
please assure me that you will act accordingly as i stated here , and if in
anyway you would not be interested , please discard this email and always
remain blessed in the name of the lord .
yours in christ ,
mrs . ruth makary .
