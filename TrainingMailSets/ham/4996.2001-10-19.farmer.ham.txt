the volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product . see rules below :
? if the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent ' s minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent , the hedge will volume will be the parent ' s minimum volume .
? for all other volumes , the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product .
please see example below :
parent ' s settings :
minimum : 5000
increment : 1000
1 - 2499 0
2500 - 5499 5000
5500 - 6499 6000
