leaders :
?
three things :
? ? ? ? ? ?
all , so i wouldn ' t even try . ? pick out the things and questions that you
feel are the most important and will hit your group the best . ? just remember
one of the icebreaker activities you have ( even if it seems cheesy ) or
somehow ask questions and get the group talking with each other or about
themselves .
?
see the note above the material about the cd in your neon box .
?
finally , i haven ' t let you know about the new leaders we have working with
us , specifically with carol poe and the backors in neon silver - - leslie and
debbie bills ! ? welcome debbie and les !
?
keep up the great work !
