residue volume issue at teco ' s indian spring plant . exxon ' s issue is that
pge .
items that were identified so that exxon ' s issue could be resolved :
1 . hpl is responsible for any ua 4 loss / gain and fuel consumed on pge ' s line
2 . if exxon ' s production exceeds 500 mcf / d , hpl must on a monthly basis
3 . if exxon ' s production flows between 100 mcf / d and 499 mcf / d , then teco
4 . if exxon ' s production is less than 100 mcf / d , then hpl must terminate
the processing agreement . if hpl does not terminate and volume continue
solution :
1 . hpl will schedule and record the gain / loss volumes at hpl meter # 986884
meter # 986884 .
3 . the scheduling of the volumes for items 1 and 2 will allow for offset
4 . the hpl logistics dept . ( mary poorman ) will inform assets group ( jack
simunek ) when and if the volumes nominated for exxon fall below 100 mcf / d .
let me know at x - 36650 .
thanks , clem
