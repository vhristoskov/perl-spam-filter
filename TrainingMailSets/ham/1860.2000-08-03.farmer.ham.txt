we are in the midst of enhancing the operations pricing model ( fka
transaction costing model ) and as a result the following applies :
- do not need the hours surveys completed for july or august
- need the activity driver surveys completed for july and august
attached is the activity driver survey for the month of july . please fill
out the attached activity driver survey with july numbers for your rc and
during the enhancment period ( july and august ) we will be standardizing and
consolidating activities across all commodities and operational functions .
for your teams . the shorter and easier surveying process will begin with the
september survey .
please call either me or shari mao at 39641 or 33859 , respectively for any
clarification . thanks for your patience and help ,
