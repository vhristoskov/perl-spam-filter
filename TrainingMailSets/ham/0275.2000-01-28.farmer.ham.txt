rest assured i know how hectic things have been around here and how many
irons you have in your fire . time for my issues are , i ' m sure , a lower
priority .
let me offer a thought or two .
expectation is you would have a plan by the time i would come back , monday
paltry salary $ ' s you are paying me . maybe a tues - thurs . week would work
don ' t need me at all .
if you could possibly let me know before the 7 th what the plan is i sure
would appreciate it .
thanks ,
ken
p . s . just in case the plug is pulled on this - - - please - - no formal goodbys .
fadeout - - ok ?
