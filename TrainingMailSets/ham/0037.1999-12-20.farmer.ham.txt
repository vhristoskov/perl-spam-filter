susan ,
please see the attached file for january ' s production estimate . this is
walter ( superior ) . they both said that they would fax their nom once it was
complete . hopefully this will be by monday . if not , all of the traders have
reviewed the estimate and made their changes . i feel pretty confident that
this is a good number . however , if your should receive any noms before
vlt
