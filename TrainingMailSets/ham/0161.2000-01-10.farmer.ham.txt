daren ,
thinking about robert ' s little memo yesterday and along the lines of pulling
strong case could be made in favor of that idea .
it is obvious that several people are involved in changing tickets , pathing ,
nominating , and confirming the industrials . this dissipates the knowledge
pops . i ' m sure this would help volume management and client services
immensely .
as the skill level rises in this area you could then gradually feed more and
they would then have a better understanding of the overhaul picture .
think not only that he has all the segments mastered , but that he is the only
person that should be involved in the industrials .
that others may be involved in the industrial activity and that is quite
alright .
once again , thanks for listening .
