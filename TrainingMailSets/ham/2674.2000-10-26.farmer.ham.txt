disposition of volumes at meter 9862 , the lehman spinaker pay meter . at this
time , the general land office is transporting their share of production
( 21 . 8945 % interest ) and hpl is purchasing the remaining 78 . 1055 % .
the glo has nominated a transport volume at meter 9848 , effective september
1 , 2000 . during this time , some test gas flowed . i have had the hpl
callout / swing so that the proper equity percentages can be allocated after
the production month by volume management .
percentage after actuals close for the month . this should alleviate any
large balance swings on their agreement .
379424 ; hpl gathering agmt . at meter 9862 . please unallocate the transport
and purchase at 9848 . the meter is a daily swing right now . let me know
when you are ready and i will change the allocation methodology .
any questions , comments , concerns , etc . i am at extension 35251 .
thank you all for your time and patience ,
mary
