it looks as though 12 / 99 was the last month a deal was entered
( if / hsc + 1 . 00 ) . george / craig - could you guys coordinate who should be rolling
this deal or let us know if this gas should not be flowing ? heidi -

i am finding flow out there on hpl 215 for meter 1520 ( tx city coastal
states ) starting 4 / 1 / 00 ( actually , no volume was scheduled but looks like it
has been allocated since march 1 ) . did you want a premium rate for this ?
