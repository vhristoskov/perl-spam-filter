hi bubba !
lacy got her eye exam yesterday . he said that she is very near sighted , but
the diabetes has not affected her eyes at all . that was a relief . she ' s been
sugars being out of control . she is doing so much better now . i have
guess her sugars out of control & all the stress of tiger dolls was what was
child with such a mean spirit . anyway things are a lot better .
tell cole that mimi hopes his eye appointment goes as well as lacy ' s . let
he couldn ' t believe her teeth are so perfect without braces . and she is so
tanned , you can see her a mile away with those white teeth shining when she
smiles . she has a dentist appointment for cleaning at the first part of next
home sat . night . love ya , maw
