2000 plan . however , please note that their are some problems / clean - up that
have broken them out . please note : gas network trading is the same group as
indicates that i have allocated over 100 % . the # ' s in gas network trading
are correct . will you please delete st gastexas so that no one will allocate
when the plan allocations were submitted last year , there was an error in
rcl 160 - volume management . i thought we corrected it but it is still
error .
i would appreciate you correcting these things for me , and forwarding the
management team on the 1 / 00 allocations , and will provide you those by
friday . please call me if you have any questions . thanks .

1 / 00 . we have changes for denver business , project sally , newco , etc . we
will discuss in the staff meeting on tuesday , 1 / 18 .
