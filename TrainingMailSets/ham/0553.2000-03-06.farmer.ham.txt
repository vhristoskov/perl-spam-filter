week for volume management .
2 / 29 / 2000 ) . the 215 k is the only one at this meter for feb . 2000
production . i don ' t see a new sitara deal number being referenced nor do i
see the evergreen flag applied here . please apprise if you can extend the
ticket for this small amount for 3 / 1 / 2000 or if you want it handled
differently .

applied . days 22 and 23 for february references the 215 k ( sitara deal
flag or a new deal number ) .
