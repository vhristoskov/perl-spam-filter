samantha ,
for monday january 24 th .
have already met with him outside
of the office . he will also need some sort of briefing on benefits if that
is possible . please let me know if this
is ok . also keep in mind that he is currently employed and has limited
flexibility . i believe that the date , january
24 th is a good day for him . i will be out of the office on jury duty but i
don ' t think that will be a problem . thanks ,
