bob , et al ,
as i am sure you recall , we had a problem with sitara positions earlier in
end of this month and the beginning of next month .
the problem with managing positions is a combination of sheer deal counts ,
sitara via the unify bridge back process . it would be ideal if we could
avoid having the bulk of the month being updated / bridged in the final
week / days of the month . i know this is the goal of logistics , but i just
the gas trading systems . perhaps a few extra pair of eyes on the pipeline
exception summary and the bridge back pipeline summary in unify this month
would help .
have 2 months " active " at a time . in other words , when november is over and
the past .
please let me know if you have any questions or comments in this area .
thanks , d . n .
