imbalance update : i spoke with mike bilberry and confirmed that this deal
really is energy in / energy out . we should not be impacted in any way by a
hpl / ena should rereceive the same volume , dth for dth at the residue or at a
redelivery point such as lobo / agua . i have left a message for my counterpart
please let me know if you have any questions or comments . i will advise
reflect the additional supply .
