contract _ event _ status . we have over 1 gig of data in that table . i would
row with a last _ mod _ date over a month ( or two ) old . so if someone balances
february 1999 this month , we will keep it around for a month ( or two ) .
of time ?
this is not an audit table . this is just a " log " every nom / track / balance / edi
send / fax send / sched qty / quick response since the beginning of time .
