sitara 147092 is tiered pricing . if you want , you can nom whatever volume is
on the deal ticket and the economics will work out correctly . it will keep
things in balance a bit better , but you can go either way . for feb there is a
base deal for 5000 / day and a term deal for 20 , 000 / day . only 15 , 000 of the
20000 is pathed .
