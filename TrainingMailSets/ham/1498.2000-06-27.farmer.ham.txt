the corresponding partner ticket will have the optionality . comments will
include the corresponding deal number , that it is in fact a buy / sell or
exchange deal and the delivery time period ( 3 , 5 or 10 days ) that the

got any ideas on how this transaction should look . this looks like a monthly
the counterparty has made their decision ( i would imagine logistics will be
indicate whether it is a 3 , 5 , 10 day delivery cycle and then indicate this
as comments .

gtc and product type description that will be used with this product type . i
will start the building process once legal provides the gtc and product type
description ; but in the interim , here ' s a broadstroke description of how the
transaction works :
party a and party b exchange gas during the month of june 2000 .
delivery during the month of june , and may take delivery in one of three
forms : 3 - day delivery , 5 - day delivery , or 10 - day delivery . the gas nominated
party b chooses 5 days for nomination , party a would deliver 20 % of the
tco pool index plus a premium .
i understand that this type of transaction is currently done
the varying ' optionality ' , do you think these three different products will
require three different product types ?
