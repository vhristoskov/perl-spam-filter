sandi ,
sorry for just now getting back with you . i was out last week .
the rate ( $ . 04 / mmbtu ) will be charged on the greater of the volumes nominated
be adjusted yearly based on cpi .
bob - i could not remember if we stated the type of settlement on the
delivered volumes ( actuals or nominations ) . i think we should use actuals
the 45 , 000 base . i also think that if the plant does increase the nom , they
you agree with this ?

daren ,

of the volumes nominated through the supply contracts or the actual
based on what index ?
thanks ,
