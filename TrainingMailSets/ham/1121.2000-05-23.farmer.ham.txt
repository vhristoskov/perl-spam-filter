eric bass , texas desk trader , requested the following product described below
stripes of start & end dates rather than one start & end date . currently ,
enrononline can
only send one start & end date per deal therefore it will fail in the bridge
since these transactions could flow next day , it is imperative that these
description below . ( this product looks like a month long deal but excludes
weekends . the " wkd " is short for week days . )
the cost / benefit of enrononline having the capability of sending multiple
dates for these types of products .
if you have any questions , please call me at 3 - 5824
thank you .
