txu revised their rates for jan 2001 . they are now billing us at $ 0 . 10 and
$ 0 . 08 for contract 1671 . this was previously billed all at $ 0 . 10 . please
have been billing us $ 0 . 11 and we have $ 0 . 10 . the extra cent is for the el
paso header fee . the pricing you gave me is for contract 1671 , but also has
the header fee if you look on page 5 of 6 . you ' ll see a a section called
" compression & header expense if utilized " . the current rate for 1856 is
$ 0 . 01 and 0 % fuel . i will leave a copy of the contract in your chair .
thanks ,
