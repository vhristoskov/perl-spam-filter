there are two fields of gas that i am having difficulty with in the unify
system .
gas on king ranch , it is my understanding hpl is selling the liquids and
there is a . 05 cent fee
at meter 415 and 9643 . this gas
will not be reflected on trans . usage ticket # 123395 and # 95394 since it is
understanding that this agreement was originally setup until texaco had
meter should be nominated on contract # ( 96006681 ) and that this agreement
if this gas is not nominated on the above transport agreement , then once
point nom or a sitara deal at meters 415 and 9643 .
