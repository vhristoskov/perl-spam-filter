based on the conversation we had at the meeting last thursday , i am
plant . if you disagree or feel you had a different understanding than the
the purchase deal .
at these meters and input on the sales deals appropriately .
ranch before swinging on 3 rivers gas . this will hopefully allow
i will hopefully have all of these changes made by the end of the day , and
have all contracts repathed . it is my understanding that we are implementing
these changes effective feb . lst .
stella , this may or may not effect repathing of the hplc gas at meter 9643 ,
based on the swing parameters that you have been using .
thank you .
