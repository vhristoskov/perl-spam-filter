rita , please help me with this . i have some questions regarding enerfin .
why are we re - allocating prior month volumes at enerfin after we matched your
process ?
no transactions with hpl ? can we simply put zero paths in unify and extend
our existing deals in sitara with zero volumes and have you guys actualize
changing volumes two , three or more times . call me if you have questions . .

hi jackie ,
copied tetco ' s volumes below that ( with the disrepancies in red ) . i was
wondering if you could double check the 3 rd , 4 th , 11 th , 12 th , 25 th , and 27 th
enron north america at that meter . it looks like maybe the volumes that you
putting in the amount that enron was allocated .
also , on the 6 th and the 19 th tetco shows exactly half of what you show ,
you have requested , before i can put anything in sitara or unify . my manager
days , since we are dealing with a prior month issue .
