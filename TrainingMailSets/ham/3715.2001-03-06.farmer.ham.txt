daren ,
system . it appears that we have not been actualizing the receipts in unify
just the deliveries - not sure why ? ? ? ? . we have been paying the suppliers
based on whatever they invoice us for , which typically has been a smaller
contact for the allocation statement . in some cases , we get the summary
sheet , but no detail and some months we don ' t get anything at all . do you
know of a good contact that we can call so that we receive the allocation on
a timely and consistent basis ? the contacts on the allocation statements
thanks ,
rw
