i think everyone agrees that there was a lot of confusion in desk assignments
and responsibilities . with that said , i am listing some of the current
these issues are none of my business , but since i see unpathed gas i thought
enron field services - has not been nominated since september 99 . have we
this assigned ? i can find old
me know .
lavaca expense transport - this is offsystem gas that hplc transports for
ena . ena has no nom at meter 1000 in pops for jan 1 .
midcon texas pipeline - there were deals left unpathed for jan 1 ( and
thought carlos was handling this one , but i could be wrong .
channel industries pipeline - several issues here :
1 . all deals with the exception of the long term transport expense were left
unpathed for jan 1 . i viewed prior month transactions and pathed
appropriately . someone
that were nominated for january .
allocate was is
not pathed and nominated .
3 . there is a transaction for january that is once again not on our point
transaction , we are not legally covered . carlos was handling this pipe in
hpl operational - this shipper on hpl has been left unpathed for december
next week . if it is left unresolved , i will get it pathed when i return .
issues .
hank eisenhours duties were split :
mandey - handle all long term hplc expense issues : undeveloped contracts ,
december flow forward and cleanup of 1999 unresolved issues .
carlos - all offsystem transactions for ena and hplc in unify and all
offsystem paper and electronic noms on intrastate pipes . ami and stacey
also handle some . there is a lot of confusion here . i found unpathed gas
hpl transports were all split by zone . each logistics rep is responsible for
pathing all meters in their assigned zones in unify .
responsibilities . the assignments above are my recollection only .
