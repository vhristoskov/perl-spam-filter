dulce and carthage . . . those are the only ones in texas that we nominate .

month ?
round 2 :
1 . the 15 , 000 @ carthage for koch is an estimate of what we anticipate we
will
actually
landolt has been our sole koch trader and he typically takes some carthage gas
currently done one month at a time . john hymel has been the trader for these
volumes .
kerr - mcgee prices the supply . . . and entex has taken all the swings . the
january volume is 2 , 312 / d .
