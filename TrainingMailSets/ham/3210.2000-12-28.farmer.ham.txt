nick ,
trail , but there is a connection between meter hpl meter 987283 , and midt
not think this is correct because the deal you reference show hplc as
purchaser . the volume is in mips under meter 989807 , but the supply deal
is set up on hpl meter 987283 , and the audit trail in sitara shows the deal
knows anything about this .
