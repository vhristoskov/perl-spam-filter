stacey ,
it looks like your missing paths revealed a quirk in our suppression of zero
non - zero on a later date . the system did not correctly determine that the
zero path should no longer be suppressed .
we have fixed the 4 paths affected and have corrected the code so this won ' t
happen any more . below is a screen print of the nov 22 problem that is now
fixed .
thanks , d . n .
