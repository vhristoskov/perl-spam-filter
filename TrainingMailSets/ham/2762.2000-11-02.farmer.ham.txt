the lakecreek lateral is baseload for the expected load , the set point may
change up and down in anticipation of weather changes but pressure supply for
entex is provided via the copano 12 " , entex shouldcommunicate with us
directly .

periodically , but it will not be pressure based upon the immediate needs of
system . whenever entex asks for a new set point at the new woodlands city
gate , our set point at the new bammel interconnect should align with that
same set point so as there is no swing service on the copano pipeline . our
service on the copano lake creek lateral . any swing provided by hpl for the
lateral because of the revised set point , but that is something that entex
has negotiated with copano independent of hpl . still fuzzy ?

steve ,
baseload means rateable flows throughout the 24 hour gas day ? no swing with
weather ?
