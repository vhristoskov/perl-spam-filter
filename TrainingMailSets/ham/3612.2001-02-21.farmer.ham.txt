sitara .
deal id if the deal is a " broker eol trade " deal . one of the drawbacks of
manager for these related deals . all other deals will have the eol deal id ,
if applicable . the eol id would not show up on the statements because it
wouldn ' t be populated .
be more time consuming . the obvious code change would be in the statement
generation area as well as other report type information .
implement .
share your thoughts . . . .
confused with broker deals done at a given point with not transportation .
any questions , please ask . . .
thanks !
