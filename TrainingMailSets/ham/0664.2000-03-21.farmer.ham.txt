this is an outside measured volume that we don ' t receive volumes on until
month ' s end so systematically , no information equals zero . spi , the software
vendor for mips is investigating all of the rules currently in place for file
zero volumes sent in the nightly file process as ( i ) incomplete . i will let
investigation .

jeff / gary ,
where is measurement in the process of sending pipeline operations more
meters and meter 980071 below is the latest casuality . when mips sends
pipeline operations a zero prelim , this becomes the best available number and
overlays the estimate that gas control sends us . when this happens &
understated . this is causing a huge mess for texas operations . what is the
charlotte ,
at what other meters are we having this problem ?

in reviewing some of the imbalance numbers , i discovered that valero texoma
of the hplc deals . this means that these purchase volumes ( expenses ) have
hit when these actual volumes flow through .
i realize that kim is out and that you guys are stretched thin , however , a
please give me a call if you have any questions .
