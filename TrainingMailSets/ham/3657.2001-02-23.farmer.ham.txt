guys ,
just thought you might find this interesting . ? i was forwarded this
regardless , of who / where ( not the point ) i find it interesting , weirdly
now i sit me down in school
where praying is against the rule
for this great nation under god
finds mention of him very odd .
if scripture now the class recites ,
it violates the bill of rights .
and anytime my head i bow
becomes a federal matter now .
our hair can be purple , orange or green ,
that ' s no offense , it ' s a freedom scene .
the law is specific , the law is precise .
prayers spoken aloud are a serious vice .
for praying in a public hall
might offend someone with no faith at all .
in silence alone we must meditate ,
god ' s name is prohibited by the state .
they ' ve outlawed guns , but first the bible .
we can elect a pregnant senior queen ,
and the ' unwed daddy , ' our senior king .
we ' re taught that such " judgments " do not belong .
we can get our condoms and birth controls ,
but the ten commandments are not allowed ,
no word of god must reach this crowd .
it ' s scary here i must confess ,
when chaos reigns the school ' s a mess .
so , lord , this silent plea i make ,
should i be shot ; my soul please take !
