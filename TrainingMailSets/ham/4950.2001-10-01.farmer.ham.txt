brian ,
our bd group . they have set a meeting up for tues . 10 / 02 / 01 . we can setup
have used , they all look pretty similar . as far as deal structure i ' m
pretty open on how we setup , but am definitely interested in equity
be actively involved in deals that we believe add value .
utilizing our combined assets as well as the liquidity sres ' s system supply
could create at an expanded waha hub .
rick ' s group will be taking the point on this project and will coordinate
others involvement as necessary within our company .
thanks

on our waha hubco project . i have attached an initial presentation on
thoughts on the commercial structure and terms you would ( or would not )
i suggest a confidentiality agreement would be appropriate as a starting
point and if you like i can forward one for your review .
