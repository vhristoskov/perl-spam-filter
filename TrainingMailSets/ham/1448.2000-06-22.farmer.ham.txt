julie ,
in 1996 , a contract was drawn up between hplr and teco gas processing ,
contract numbers 078 - 86978 - 101 / 078 - 86978 - 301 . in april ' 99 , these contracts
volumes started appearing in my purchase payment statements under sitara
purchase deal numbers which i have been using are sitara # 14086 and sitara
be for hplc . donald reinhart stated that spot purchase and spot sale gtc ' s
contract is changed . amelia alland has set these up , which i believe
purchases : 012 - 86978 - 102 ; global 96021450
sales : 012 - 86978 - 301 ; global 96021451
per our conversation earlier can you make these retroactive adjustments ?
when complete , can you tell me what the new deal numbers will be ?
thank you so much for your help and let me know if you need additional
information .
let me know if something i stated is incorrect or if anyone has any
additional information .
