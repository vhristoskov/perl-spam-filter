donna ,
managers for input :
this has been mentioned in the past , but has had some related " baggage " :
- impact on performance , may run slower . could make it an option so you pay
the price when you need it .
- agreed format for those deals that have index pricing and percentage and
fixed price offset ( ie 98 % of if . transco . znl + . 02 )
preference .
let me know what you hear . d . n .
