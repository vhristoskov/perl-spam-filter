fred or anita ,
meter 3527 : tivoli station . for bryancy ' s allocation , she must take the meter
she can take that net number and do an allocation between texas general land
and hpl ( cleco ) like she has done previously . i believe meter 785 is now a
check meter and meter 3527 is the actual pay meter .
and 449243 . per discussions with daren farmer , danny conner , and jennifer
449243 as the correct deal number . therefore , fred boas and i have zeroed
449243 . deal 397957 was priced at ship less . 18 which was incorrect and deal
449243 is priced at ship less . 15 . therefore , an adjustment will generate
for 9 / 00 for the difference in price and the change in location . the
allocated volume for cleco did not change . however , i am not sure that
bryancy is allocating the volume properly between texas general land and hpl
funderbruk with cleco so there might be some pma ' s for volume differences .
should be computed by taking meter 3527 deducting out meter 9662 . then
byancy should take this net number and split it between texas general land
and hpl ( cleco ) . the texas general land nom is currently at meter 785 and
the hpl ( cleco ) deal is at meter 3527 . fred mentioned that the texas general
that yet .
please let me know if something i have stated is not your understanding or
doing all the points ( meters 3527 , 9662 , 785 ) . thanks for your help ! ! !
