gary ,
when spinnaker got paid , the volumes inadvertently got averaged over the
month . since spinnaker was paid gas
the volumes are re - sent over on the actual
day of flow . in my calculations ( using gas daily less $ . 21 as the price ) we
$ 220 , 398 . 57 .
attached is a spreadsheet showing where i came up with the extra money owed :
thank you all ! !

ps this does not address the issue between the onshore and offshore meter ,
this is just addressing the redistribution
