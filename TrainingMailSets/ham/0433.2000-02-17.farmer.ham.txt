of you contributed concerns and discussion ideas in a very professional and
these discussions as " quarterly " or " monthly " meetings at this point - i ' m
not sure what frequency would be appropriate . we can discuss it further as a
team . however , i know we at least one more session and i don ' t want much
yvette : would look at a time when everyone would be availble in march ,
as daren will be working around a new baby , and others are working around
