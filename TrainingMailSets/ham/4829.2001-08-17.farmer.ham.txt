jay ,
for june , i need a couple of things changed in sitara :
and for july . . . . . . . . . . . .
it looks like we ' re missing some volume . . . . . . . . . . . .
deal 895651 - baseload deal - should have 55 , 000 per day allocated . and in sitara this deal should be priced at $ 3 . 0505 .
deal 895691 - swing deal - currently has 234 , 000 in the scheduled column and it should be 441 , 000 based on the spreadsheet i sent . did you have some conflicting volumes ? i ' m resending what the volumes should be . and the pricing for this should be at waha . hub . gdp . d . a + . 02 .

valerie ,
the volume of 50 , 000 for deal 819594 was a mistake . the proper value was 30 , 000 just as you had mentioned . everything should now be fixed . please let me know if you need anything else .
thanks ,
jay smith
