it ' s that time again for the monthly and quarterly volumetric explanations !
the database for may is now ready for viewing . just as a reminder , this is
relations requests that business analysis & reporting provide monthly
analysis . please review the analysis for may 2000 and provide explanations
for all material changes ( + / - 10 % ) for the year / year , quarter / quarter , and
questions , but it may be used for ad hoc requests and presentations . it is
essential that the volumes be verified by commercial personnel .
thanks ,
