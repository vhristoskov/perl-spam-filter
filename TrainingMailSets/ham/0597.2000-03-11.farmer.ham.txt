robert ,
i ' ve taken care of 98 - 6719 ( as far as getting it out of my allocation
should daren or julie get back w / you , while i ' m on vacation , please get back
as well as the dates of 2 / 1 - 2 / 29 ( even though 3 / 1 / 2000 is reflected in my
it looks as though this meter is flowing starting 3 / 1 / 2000 . i guess that the
trader will eventually place a deal in sitara for this meter .
thanks
