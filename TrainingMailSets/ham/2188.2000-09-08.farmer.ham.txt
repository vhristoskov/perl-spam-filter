board of jdf representing enron and will be enron ' s corporate executive for
this year ' s fundraising efforts .
as many of you may already know , i am an insulin dependent diabetic myself .
multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day , i cannot
imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease . taking
insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of
complications ; insulin is simply their life support system and without it
they would die .
is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84 % of all money
$ 225 , 000 and we need your help . enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5
for this great event . the walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 enron
people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it .
members listed below . if you are interested in being a team leader , please
contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included
in the first important and informative training session taking place this
week .
thank you very much for your support .
