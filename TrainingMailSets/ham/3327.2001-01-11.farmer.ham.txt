beaumont interconnect ( replace some valves , i believe ) .
we had discussed doing this at a time when mobil beaumont refinery would have
mobil will take down some of the units at different times during the month .
some of these units are endothermic , some are exothermic , so in some cases
their gas load goes up when they take certain units down . but based on the
schedule of ups and downs that i ' ve been given , it looks like their gas load
will be at a low point between february 1 and february 12 , at somewhere
through the low pressure meter , and delivering the rest through centana . is
this still the plan ? ?
do : that it would take less than a day , and that during that time , hpl would
conservative
one thing of concern : in the past two months , we have effected some of our
maintenance .
once you gents let me know what you game plan is and confirm how we ' ll handle
of coordination because i can guarantee you that mobil ' s maintenance schedule
will change !
