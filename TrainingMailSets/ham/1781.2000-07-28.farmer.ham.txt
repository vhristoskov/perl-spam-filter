panenergy purchase : deal # 231758 .
deal # 231758 .
however , scheduling has indicated that they have no sale for that gas on day
one and as a result , it is not pathed in the system .
could you please review this item and see if it should or shouldn ' t be a sale
so that scheduling can either path april lst or i can dispute the volume
this is part of pan energy ' s exchange deal .

katherine ,
this is a brokered deal ( buy deal 231758 and sell deal 93472 ) . this first
day was not pathed , that ' s why you are missing volume of 271 . per carlos
( see below ) the deal was not for day one .
