as you are aware , the unify system experienced significant performance
the problem was exacerbated by a multitude of additional user logins thinking
that a fresh login might work better . additional logins never improve
the good news is that we found out what caused the problem . it was not a
particular user or a particular report or process . it was actually an
the past , but this particular change had drastic side effects . we have
behavior is a " feature " or a bug . in the meanwhile , we will do these types
of changes at night during scheduled outages .
i apologize for the frustration , anxiety , and extra work brought on by this
call .
