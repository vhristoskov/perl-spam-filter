at minimum for 6 months or the production has been released . in the case of
meter 0989740 in 11 / 98 and the remaining wells are non - producing .
resultingly , the only viable option for resolution is option 2 . we should
vlt

vance :
depending on whether the wellheads are producing or not .
non - producing : should we determine that the common point and any wells
deal , if possible . since the deal is older , we probably sold lower priced
in a financial loss ) .
as i ascertain that date .
they are being captured properly , both at a book level and at a state filing
this .
thank you again for all of your hard work in this area ,
