daren ,
i ' m not sure if you are the person that can make this change for me . if you
for meter # 78033 and # 78032 for 3 / 00 production forward , this deal is set
up under the wrong sitara # , therefore the volumes are not pulling in sitara .
was only for 1 / 00 production . the new sitara number that we should be using
is
sitara # 156387 ( for meter # 78033 ) and sitara # 156383 ( for meter # 78032
( this was for 2 / 00 production )
could you please let me know when the change has been made or if there is
thanks , stephanie ( 3 - 6004 )
