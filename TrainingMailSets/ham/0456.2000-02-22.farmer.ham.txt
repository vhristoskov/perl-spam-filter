hey guys ,
that howard should have been the driving force behind this . once we left the
with howard sitting down doing much of the work . i also think that the below
the logistics group . i understand that howard has prior scheduling
experience , but he is not functioning in a scheduling role now and bascially
( ? ) . in my opinion this is a kudoo for howard for stepping up , but i am
concerned at the role that he played . team effort is important and it ' s what
fair share and expectations are appropriately placed . let me know what you
both think . thanks !
