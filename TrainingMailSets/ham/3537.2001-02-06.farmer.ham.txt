was perfect . while my game stunk overall ( 118 ) , i did manage par on one par
3 and two par 5 ' s . the best was at 14 - - - a 545 yard par 5 . my drive was
pin in 3 , and then two - putted . those three pars however will keep me going
back . remember , i had a witness !
feats on our next outing . hope all are doing well . we ' re remembering
rachel and jake in our prayers each day .
