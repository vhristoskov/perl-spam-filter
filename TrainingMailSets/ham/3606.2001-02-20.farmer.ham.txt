i did not know that this was part of a natural gas / crude oil exchange deal
and billed texas general land office for the gas sale in jan . 01
if so , will this a / r balance of $ 974 , 144 . 00 be netted against the crude oil
payable in sap ?

texas general land office has called and is disputing that this sale is a
part of the month exchange deal for transport .
do we have the name of the trader at texas general land office that did this
deal with us ?
the sale was for 01 / 01 - 01 / 31 for 99 , 200 mmbtus at $ 9 . 82 .
