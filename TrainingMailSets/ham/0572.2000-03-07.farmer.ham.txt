have tickets out there with zero volumes on them that get updated after the
allocated . what we found out that happened was that in the last week of
noticed the incorrect volumes on these tickets and had logistics zero them
out . darren thought that the changes would have no position effect as if it
were a deal between hplc and texas , but it is actuall as if we changed a deal
that we did with another region . the value was offset by changes in tufco
the day . hope you had fun at the school function . i ' ll be here until about
