i spoke with daren and there are a few contracts that he was aware of :
2 . oasis and pgev - hpl is using ena ' s capacity
3 . tejas ship and tejas gas - daren says we don ' t do business often on these pipes as ena , but we always have the possibility that we will at any time , so ena would need it ' s own transport contracts
let me know if anyone has questions . thanks !
