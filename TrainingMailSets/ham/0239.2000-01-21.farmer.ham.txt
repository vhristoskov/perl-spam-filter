for beaumont methanol at meter # 1428 .
first some background : we feed beaumont methanol through a meter station
that we own and control , but which also feeds brandywine / dupont . in fact ,
the gas goes through a dupont pipeline header downstream of our meter station
both beaumont methanol and brandywine / dupont . . . . . but sometime we only do
business with one of them .
bob dorcheus - brandywine / dupont - 281 - 293 - 1789
chyral hankins - beaumont methanol ( terra ) - 712 - 233 - 6558
please do not call the beaumont methanol control room at the plant with
these issues . if we call the beaumont methanol control room at the plant
methanol plant control room on any emergency operational issues .
thanks . . . and have a great weekend .
