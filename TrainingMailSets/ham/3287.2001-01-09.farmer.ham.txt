daren :
pipeline at the above meter that is owned by duke energy trading and
contract # 960439646 , and deal # 133196 that expired on 8 / 31 / 2000 . effective
deal # 466305 , but this deal expires on 11 / 30 / 2000 .
or
in addition , since deal # 466305 expires on 11 / 30 / 2000 and gas is still
flowing , logistics needs either ( 1 ) deal # 466305 extended , or ( 2 ) a new deal
