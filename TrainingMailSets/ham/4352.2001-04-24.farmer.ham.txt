daren ,
when i look back in cpr for the delivery periods of 10 / 00 - 12 / 00 on cpr pipeline exchange , i do not see anything being flashed as an imbalance , i . e . the buys and sales always equal in cpr . however , we are booking an imbalance every month on the parking and lending contract . should there be something in cpr for these volumes ? let me know because it is causing an oa variance for us . thanks !
