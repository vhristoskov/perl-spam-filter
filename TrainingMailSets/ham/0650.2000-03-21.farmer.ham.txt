daren and lauri :
we do have a problem with some of our mirrored meters . when mips receives an
big problem . our pops team ( romeo d ' souza ) has identified this problem and
mean time we are overriding the volumes in pops with the estimated volumes .
this was corrected this morning and the meter re - allocated .
thanks ,
charlotte

in reviewing some of the imbalance numbers , i discovered that valero texoma
of the hplc deals . this means that these purchase volumes ( expenses ) have
hit when these actual volumes flow through .
i realize that kim is out and that you guys are stretched thin , however , a
please give me a call if you have any questions .
