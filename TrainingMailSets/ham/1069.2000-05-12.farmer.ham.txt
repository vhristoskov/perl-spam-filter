charlotte ,
there is an interconnect variance at meter 980071 for 2 / 99 . it appears the
variance is created on 2 / 9 / 99 and 2 / 10 / 99 . there is a transport usage deal
and 3 , 683 mmbtu on 2 / 10 / 99 , but hpl does not show a receipt of this volume .
let me know if you need the pg & e support .
