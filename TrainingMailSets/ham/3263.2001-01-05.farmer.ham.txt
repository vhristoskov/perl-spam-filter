i am having trouble with the transport deal for the tenaska iv contracts on
lone star . we have deal 452491 in sitara for meter 20014804 at a $ 0 . 01
agree with our deal . they are billing for meter 25000200 at $ 0 . 10 and meter
and the tenaska marketing deal 459898 , respectively . should our deal match
what txu is billing or is there another deal that i am missing ? i haven ' t
worked with transport very much , so i could be confused . i think we have
this problem with oct 2000 , also , but i have not reviewed it yet . i am going
adjustments below and attached my spreadsheet . the unify adjustments will be
( difference $ 152 , 115 . 27 )
( difference $ 7 , 340 . 95 )
( difference $ 19 . 72 )
thanks ,
megan
