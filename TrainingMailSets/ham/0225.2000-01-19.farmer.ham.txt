i ' ve discussed the carthage plant imbalance with chad cass at duke energy
acknowledged that an imbalance existed but didn ' t think it was that high .
both
in
estimates , duke thinks january sales are 1 , 000 - 2 , 000 / day higher than
with this daily overage , based on their production estimates , but since they
available for sale by 4 , 000 / day effective friday the 21 st . this will reduce
at carthage .
5 , 000 / day , continuing until the imbalance is worked off . devon should reduce
enron
setting up february activity .
agree on , is that ces , now enron , purchases devon ' s carthage gas at the
tailgate of the plant , so any production - related imbalance is between devon
and
devon ' s agent at carthage , duke communicates the imbalance information and
make - up . hopefully once actual make - up commences , devon and duke will strive
please call me if you have any questions @ ( 713 ) 693 - 2581 .
